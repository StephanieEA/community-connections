## Community Connections

#### 

My app matches seniors with spare rooms and students that need housing, based on the time available each could spend with the other and shared interests.  It's inspired by the HUMANITAS house in the Netherlands, where students stay at the nursing home rent-free, in exchange for 30 hours of service with the residents.  Such programs or matches could not only help ease the social isolation that can come with aging and the financial burden of higher education, but help break down age-segregation in society.  

## Project Status
Right now there is just the entry form for the user and needs to be more expansively tested.  Obviously, there is a long way to go but was has been developed has been done so with attention to detail and accessibility.  
#### Example:

This project is currently in development. Users can add a senior account.
